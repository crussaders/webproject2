Crysis 3 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
 Officially announced 16 April 2012, it is the third main installment of the Crysis series, a sequel to the 2011 video game Crysis 2.
 The multiplayer portion of the game was developed by Crytek UK

<br>

Set in the year 2047, the game takes place in New York City, which has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation, and turned into a veritable urban rainforest.
 Crysis 3's story revolves around Alcatraz, Prophet's successor, and a Nanosuit holder who is on a quest to take revenge on the Alpha Ceph, the leader of the Ceph alien race, with the help of Prophet's former comrade, Psycho.
 The game's story serves as the end of the Crysis trilogy. 
Gameplay revolves around the use of the Nanosuit, which grants players a variety of abilities such as being invisible.
 New features introduced in Crysis 3 include a new Nanosuit ability called "Rip & Throw", a new compound bow and the "hacking" feature, which allows players to hack into enemies' equipment, drones, and automated security defenses.

<br>

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City, in an effort to combine the urban landscape of Crysis 2 and the forest setting of the original Crysis.
 The game introduces the "Seven Wonders", with each wonder having its own unique landscape and tactical layout.
 Due to complaints about Crysis 2's linearity, the game's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom.
 The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story, and the story's protagonist, Alcatraz, was inspired by the lead character of District 9. 
The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23-month development cycle.

<br>

Crysis 3 was met with positive reception after its release.
 Praise was directed at the game's level design, visuals and multiplayer, while it was criticised for its story and length.
 With a budget of $66 million, the game sold 205,000 copies in its debut month, and became a commercial failure for Electronic Arts. 
The game was later included in The Crysis Trilogy, a bundle released on 20 February 2014.

<p id="para1">
Similar to the earlier games in the Crysis series, Crysis 3 is a first-person shooter.
 Players take control of Prophet as he progresses through New York City to defeat the Ceph, a technologically advanced alien race.
 Throughout the game, players can slide, sprint, jump and crouch. When encountering enemies, players can defeat them by using guns or a compound bow, utilizing explosives like grenades and C4, or by performing a melee attack.
 Performing certain movements takes up energy from the Nanosuit, the armor worn by Prophet.
 Some abilities are not available for players to perform or utilize if the Nanosuit's energy is too low;
 they must wait until energy is refilled. As a result, players are tasked to manage the use of the energy.
 The game's artificial intelligence was updated allowing enemies to react more quickly to players' attacks. 
Enemies can take cover when attacked, and can employ strategy to assist and support each other against attacks.
<br>
The Nanosuit allows players to identify the threat level, and the weapons held by enemies. 
Players can tag enemies and items by enabling visor, and can spot enemies using Nano-Vision, which detects the heat of both enemies and allies.
Levels are more open-ended than in Crysis 2. 
Players are given more freedom, and can choose a gameplay style based on direct confrontation, or a more discreet and stealthy approach, in order to deal with enemies and to complete their objectives.
There is no definite way to beat the game's seven levels.
 Instead, players can take different alternate routes to reach their objectives.
 Players can fight against enemies utilizing a wide array of gadgets and weapons, and by using the abilities granted by the Nanosuit.
 They can utilize an invisibility cloak to evade enemies, prevent themselves from being detected, or to perform silent takedowns.
 The nanosuit also has an armor mode, which reduces the amount of damage taken, in exchange for slower movement speed.
 New weapons are introduced in Crysis 3, such as a compound bow. Players can use the bow while in cloak mode.
 When using other firearms, the cloak is disrupted and can no longer function until it cools down.
Arrows can be collected by players after use.
Players can hack into enemies' technology, one of the game's new features. 
In addition, players can hack security codes, weapon boxes, Ceph technology, mines, lasers, and sentry turrets, which can all be used to fight against enemies.
 Players can also upgrade and customize their weapons and the Nanosuit. 
They can change the attachment and ammo types for their weapons. 
For instance, players can change between explosive arrows and electric arrows for their bow.
 The Nanosuit can be upgraded by collecting different "Suit upgrade modeules" scattered across the world. 
These upgrades can increase the suit's properties, and strengthen or unlock new abilities for players as they progress through the game.

 Gameplay remains similar when playing the multiplayer mode.
 Unlike the single-player campaign, when players sprint or boost their armor in the multiplayer modes, it does use any nanosuit energy.
There are 8 different modes, with a total of 12 available maps to play on.
 They are Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Crash Site / Spears, Capture the Relay / Extraction, Hunter, Assault, Cell Vs Rebel, Developers Choice, Maximum Team Deathmatch, and Maximum Deathmatch.
Scattered throughout each map are special alien weapons with scarce ammo and can be picked up by players.
Players also have a new passive ability called Rip and Throw,in which they interact with environmental objects to create obstacles for hostile players and tactical advantages for themselves.
This interactibility with the environment was pushed heavily upon the team by their publisher, EA.
 A refined kill streak system is introduced in Crysis 3, allowing players to gain rewards by killing hostile players simultaneously while collecting their dog tag.
This refined kill system involves collecting dog tags that are dropped by enemy players when killed.
 The perks gained from this vary from map to map. 
They are Maximum Radar, Swarmer, Gamma Burst, EMP, and Maximum Nanosuit, which reveals enemy players locations on the mini-map.

In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, a new multiplayer mode, the Hunter mode, is featured in the game.
 It is an asymmetrical multiplayer mode which pits two teams of players, playing as either hunters, or troopers from CELL, against each other. The three CELL classes are equipped with completely different weapons, and defeated troopers respawn as hunters and have to defeat their former teammates.
 Hunters are equipped with the nanosuit and infinite cloak, as well as the Hunter Bow, which allows the hunter to fire while they're cloaked.
 The hunters also have access to a Thermite Arrow tip, and the CELL have various explosives and weapons that change depending on class selected.
The PC version of the game can accommodate up to 16 players, while the console versions can only support 12 players.
